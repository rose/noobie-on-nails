**Noobie on Nails**
*The web framework for the 90s and beyond*

Welcome to Noobie on Nails, the best thing to happen on the web since PHP!

With Noobie, you don't have to muck around with templating languages, preprocessors, or Firefox.  Just clone this repository, cd into http-server, and run 

`ruby app.rb`

and you'll be on your way to fame and fortune!  Direct Chrome to localhost:9393/greet/YourName and get a **free** personalized greeting as our thanks for joining Team Noobie.  Rest easy in the knowledge that Firefox-using scum will be unable to sully your pristine apps with their beady little eyes, thanks to our **custom** http parsing technology.

Put some files in root.  Follow the examples in app.rb to create your own routes, and you'll be on your way to success... *The Noobie Way*.
